#### Derivatives-models-short rate model calibration framework

#### C++ Short-Rate Model Calibration Framework ‚öôÔ∏è

This project provides a C++ framework for calibrating one-factor short-rate models to current market conditions. It's designed to be a clear, practical, and extensible tool for quantitative finance applications.

#### Overview

Short-rate models are fundamental in finance for pricing interest rate derivatives. Before they can be used, they must be **calibrated**‚Äîtheir parameters must be adjusted so that they accurately price basic market instruments, like zero-coupon bonds.

This project demonstrates the entire calibration workflow:
1.  **Market Data**: Defining a yield curve from market observations.
2.  **Model Pricing**: Using the analytical formulas of a model (like Hull-White) to price bonds.
3.  **Error Calculation**: Measuring the difference between the model's prices and market prices.
4.  **Optimization**: Finding the model parameters that minimize this difference.

#### Models Implemented

This framework is built around an abstract base class `ShortRateModel`, making it easy to add new models.

| Model                  | Key Features                                       | Implementation Status                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hull-White** | Mean Reversion, Normal Distribution (allows negative rates) | **Fully Implemented** (Analytical Solution)              |
| **Ho-Lee** | No Mean Reversion, Normal Distribution             | **Fully Implemented** (Analytical Solution)              |
| **Black-Derman-Toy (BDT)** | Lognormal Distribution (no negative rates)         | **Structure Only** (Requires numerical tree) |
| **Black-Karasinski** | Mean Reversion, Lognormal Distribution             | **Structure Only** (Requires numerical tree) |

*The lognormal models (BDT, Black-Karasinski) do not have closed-form solutions for bond prices and require numerical methods like binomial or trinomial trees for implementation.*

#### How to Build and Run

You'll need a C++ compiler (supporting C++20) and CMake.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ShortRateModelCalibration

# 2. Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# 3. Run CMake and build the project
cmake ..
make

# 4. Run the calibrator executable
./Calibrator
```

### Example Output

```
Setting up market data...
Initial short rate (r0) set to: 0.01

--- Hull-White Model Calibration ---
Initial Guess: a = 0.1, sigma = 0.01

Prices with initial (uncalibrated) parameters:
Maturity | Market Price | Model Price | Difference
---------|--------------|-------------|-----------
0.25     | 0.997503     | 0.997505    | -0.000002
0.50     | 0.994018     | 0.994042    | -0.000024
1.00     | 0.985112     | 0.985310    | -0.000199
...

--- Optimization Step (Conceptual) ---
To calibrate, you would feed the 'objectiveFunction' into an optimizer.
The optimizer (e.g., Levenberg-Marquardt, Nelder-Mead) would search for
the values of 'a' and 'sigma' that minimize the sum of squared errors.

Initial Sum of Squared Errors: 1.2345e-06

#### üî¨ Calibration Process Explained

The `main.cpp` file walks through the calibration process conceptually:

1.  **Market Data Setup**: We start with a `std::map` representing the market zero-coupon yield curve and convert it to bond prices. This is our "ground truth".

2.  **Objective Function**: The heart of calibration is the `objectiveFunction`. It takes model parameters (`a`, `sigma`) as input and returns a single number: the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** between the prices from our model and the actual market prices.

3.  **Optimization**: In a real-world application, you would use a numerical optimization library (like [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org/), or Boost.Math) to find the parameters `a` and `sigma` that **minimize** the value returned by the `objectiveFunction`. The code demonstrates this conceptually by showing that a "calibrated" set of parameters results in a lower error.

#### Next Steps & Extensions

* **Implement a Numerical Optimizer**: Integrate a library like NLopt to perform the minimization automatically.
* **Build Tree Pricers**: Implement binomial trees for the BDT and Black-Karasinski models.
* **Price Derivatives**: Extend the models to price interest rate caps, floors, and swaptions.
* **Use Real Market Data**: Connect the application to a data source to pull in real-time yield curves.
