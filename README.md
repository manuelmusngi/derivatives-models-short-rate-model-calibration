# derivatives-models-interest-rates

This project is a reference for derivatives modeling for interest-rates. 

Single‑factor interest rate derivatives models are a core class of short‑rate models where the entire term structure of interest rates is driven by a single state variable — the short rate 
𝑟(𝑡). Once you know the short rate’s path, the interest‑rate derivatives can be determined.
